Develop a GUI for Linux PyQt5/6

It should show me folders in one or all of the following:

My Repos

/home/daniel/Development/git-repositories/My-Repos

My Forks

/home/daniel/Development/git-repositories/My-Forks

My Clones

/home/daniel/Development/git-repositories/Cloned-Repos

Desired behavior

Instant keyword searching through these folders to find the correct folder

Fuzzy logic to support quick matching

Open buttons for:

VS Code (preface code)

Click to open that repo in desired IDE
